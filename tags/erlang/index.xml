      <description>i have been working on an iso8583 parsing library for time.
its written in erlang but can be used in erlang,elixir,lfe,etc.. basically all beam languages. this library can be used for packing and unpacking iso8583 financial messages.
It accepts a specification file which contains info about fields,mti,bitmap for your messages. The specification has info such as header length for various fields,padding info for fields,etc&amp;hellip; This specification information is then used for packing/unpacking iso8583 formatted messages.</description>

      <description>Web templating languages!!. Don&amp;rsquo;t we love em.
Every one has their favourite but a common denominator among them all is that they make our work as web developers easier by giving us separation of concerns between data and content as well as lots of other advantages. A fancy term for web templating languages is a web template system.
From Wikipedia a Web template system is defined as
A web template system uses a template processor to combine web templates to form finished web pages, possibly using some data source to customize the pages or present a large amount of content on similar-looking pages</description>

      <description>Today we will be showing how to extract the various components out of an iso string. The combination of a tcp server as well as code to extract the iso message components and send it for further processing is what is popularly called an interface server in payment processing . Specifically the components we are interested in are
message type indicator also known as mti bitmap data elements The code snippets used for this post is in this git repository.</description>

      <description>Today we are going to talk about creating a tcp server to parse iso messages using erlang .
This tutorial explains the very basic of creating tcp servers in erlang . there are better specialized libraries out there (ranch) for creating tcp servers and pools of them but this is very basic and we need just a simple tcp server to show how to process incoming iso messages .Â We will be using the 1993 iso8583 ascii protocol format.</description>
