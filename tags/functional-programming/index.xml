      <description>Hi All.Hope you are all good.
Recently i had the chance to rewrite some sections of code i had written in javascript over to elm and wanted to share my experience with it.
I had been experiencing an issue where the screen content was being updated too quickly causing the screen to become unresponsive
Elm is a static functional programming language which is mostly used on the frontend which boasts having no runtime exceptions.</description>
