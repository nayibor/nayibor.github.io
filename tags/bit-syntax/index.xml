      <description>hello everyone and happy new year to one and all!!. hope everyone had a very wondeful holiday filled with joy,happiness and wishing more positive happenings in this year. i worked on a small bit of code late last year which involved working with some audio data where i had to do some bit syntax and bit manipulation to get the various metadata and parts of an audio file either over the network being streamed or a file on disk Erlang and erlang related languages(Elixir,Lfe,Luerl) have this short and nifty way of unpacking this data out and getting the various sections efficiently and also with a small bit of code it takes a little bit of getting used to but its very powerful none the less</description>
