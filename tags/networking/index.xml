      <description>I gave a talk recently at ElxirKenya about how to communicate with the outside world from elixir. The ecosystem for talking to the outside world from beam systems has a lot of options. Beyond the ports,nifs,interfaces,distributed erlang i found a new language ziglang. ziglang was interesting not only for creating nifs but also as a possible future replacement for writing simple,fast,safe code This is the talk as well as a video about why to use zig to write nifs enjoy !</description>
