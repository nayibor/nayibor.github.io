      <description>Hi All.Hope you are all good.
Recently i had the chance to rewrite some sections of code i had written in javascript over to elm and wanted to share my experience with it.
I had been experiencing an issue where a web dashboard which was being used for monitoring of a service was receiving information too quickly thus causing the dashboard to become unresponsive.
the use case seemed like a good fit for elm where i had to rewrite a specific section of the dashboard so i decided to try out elm for this use case and see how it goes</description>

      <description>I gave a talk recently at ElxirKenya about how to communicate with the outside world from elixir. The ecosystem for talking to the outside world from beam systems has a lot of options. Beyond the ports,nifs,interfaces,distributed erlang i found a new language ziglang. ziglang was interesting not only for creating nifs but also as a possible future replacement for writing simple,fast,safe code This is the talk as well as a video about why to use zig to write nifs enjoy !</description>

      <description>Conferences/communities are a great way for everyone to network and learn something new. the effect of the pandemic on how these events are organized has been interesting. its made people have to innovate around the organization of events. there have been some positives out of this as well as some negatives i have attended three erlang/elixir online conferences(two of my best languages) so far this year and its been interesting the positives/negatives as well as what the future may bring</description>

      <description>i have been working on an iso8583 parsing library for time.
its written in erlang but can be used in erlang,elixir,lfe,etc.. basically all beam languages. this library can be used for packing and unpacking iso8583 financial messages.
It accepts a specification file which contains info about fields,mti,bitmap for your messages. The specification has info such as header length for various fields,padding info for fields,etc&amp;hellip; This specification information is then used for packing/unpacking iso8583 formatted messages.</description>

      <description>Today we are going to talk about how to deploy our code to our testing server or production server using git/apache. In this scenario git will be taking the place of the tradional method of using ftp servers to upload code to a server.
We will get to know how to
configure a remote git repository so it checks out data to a web root location configure apache and create an apache conf file that will enable communication between the git repository and apache setup authenticaton in apache for git events push to remote repository and see files in web root Let&amp;rsquo;s hit the road!</description>

      <description>Web templating languages!!. Don&amp;rsquo;t we love em.
Every one has their favourite but a common denominator among them all is that they make our work as web developers easier by giving us separation of concerns between data and content as well as lots of other advantages. A fancy term for web templating languages is a web template system.
From Wikipedia a Web template system is defined as
A web template system uses a template processor to combine web templates to form finished web pages, possibly using some data source to customize the pages or present a large amount of content on similar-looking pages</description>

      <description>Today we will be showing how to extract the various components out of an iso string. The combination of a tcp server as well as code to extract the iso message components and send it for further processing is what is popularly called an interface server in payment processing . Specifically the components we are interested in are
message type indicator also known as mti bitmap data elements The code snippets used for this post is in this git repository.</description>

      <description>Today we are going to talk about creating a tcp server to parse iso messages using erlang .
This tutorial explains the very basic of creating tcp servers in erlang . there are better specialized libraries out there (ranch) for creating tcp servers and pools of them but this is very basic and we need just a simple tcp server to show how to process incoming iso messages . We will be using the 1993 iso8583 ascii protocol format.</description>

      <description>alloha.
at last i have been able to get my lazy behind to write a blog post on this.
About time :).
This will be the first in a series about parsing iso8583 financial messages using erlang.
we will get to know
about iso8583 and the message structure receiving iso 8583 messages over the wire using erlang tcp server and parsing the message . parsing those messages in various formats(text(acii),binary,custom format).</description>
